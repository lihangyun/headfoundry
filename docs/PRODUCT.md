# HeadFoundry product status

Last updated: 2026-09-12 at commit `826c5770fc1a2b42b035d2dc01d3780c6ceae774`.

## What exists

- A Python package under `src/headfoundry` with fail-closed rights/input manifests, camera conventions and gates, commercial-checkpoint adapters, depth/camera diagnostics, surface fitting, clipping, rasterization and profile diagnostics.
- Deterministic fixtures and regression tests under `tests`, plus pinned asset identities and example manifests under `examples`.
- A clean-room research trail in `docs`, including the governing ADR, claim/source ledger and numbered experiments.
- Experimental OBJ/head rendering on local authorized photographs. Private inputs and identity-derived artifacts stay under ignored local paths.
- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/lihangyun/headfoundry.git`, branch `main`.

## Current result

The camera and full visual acceptance gates have not passed. Experiment 0101 fits 51 source-visible lip-seam constraints, but six become occluded and the area guard stops further fitting. Profile metrics can improve while the rendered identity remains generic, so this candidate is `REJECT` for promotion. KeenTools-level parity remains `UNVERIFIED`.

## How to verify the public code

From `C:\workspace\headfoundry`:

```powershell
C:\Python313\python.exe -m pip install -e .
C:\Python313\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
C:\Python313\python.exe -m headfoundry.camera
C:\Python313\python.exe -m headfoundry.vggt tests\fixtures\vggt_camera_point_fixture.json
```

The repository is a library and experiment workspace, not a long-running service, so there is no start/stop procedure or deployment target. Publishing currently means committing reviewed public changes and pushing `main`; it does not publish private assets or constitute model-quality acceptance.

## Next gate

Update lip visibility and nearest photo-curve targets during each bounded fitting step. Report errors on the original fixed supports as well as the active visible set so occlusion or dropped observations cannot manufacture improvement. Then inspect the actual five-view renders, especially both profiles, before considering any geometry promotion.

## Known pitfalls

- A model or repository license does not automatically grant rights to every checkpoint or training dataset.
- Positive depth, valid matrices and lower reprojection error do not prove correct camera calibration or identity reconstruction.
- Shrinking internal lip gaps, valid triangle orientation and sampled no-crossing sections do not prove natural closure or full collision freedom.
- Actual photos and derived biometric/identity artifacts are local-only under the current consent and must not enter Git, PCR or public reports.
